# Repository Instructions

Canonical source: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

If any instruction in this file conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.

## Core Rules

- Respect directory boundaries:
  - Backend: `src/`, `data_provider/`, `api/`, `bot/`
  - Web: `apps/dsa-web/`
  - Desktop: `apps/dsa-desktop/`
  - Deployment/workflows: `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, `docker/`
- Do not run `git commit`, `git tag`, or `git push` without explicit user confirmation.
- Do not hardcode secrets, accounts, ports, model names, absolute environment-specific paths, or environment-specific branches.
- Reuse existing modules, configuration entrypoints, scripts, and tests instead of adding parallel implementations.
- For user-visible behavior changes, CLI/API changes, deployment changes, notification changes, or report-structure changes, update the relevant docs and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- In `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, the `[Unreleased]` section uses a **flat format**: one line per entry formatted as `- [type] description`, where type is one of `新功能`/`改进`/`修复`/`文档`/`测试`/`chore`. **Do not add `### category headers` inside `[Unreleased]`** to minimize merge conflicts in concurrent PRs. A maintainer will reorganize into the full categorized format at release time.
- Use `README.md` for getting started, runtime/deployment, and high-level capability summaries; put detailed module behavior, page interaction, and troubleshooting guidance in the appropriate `docs/*.md` file.
- If `README.md` is not updated, explain why and point to the document that was updated instead.
- When config semantics change, sync `.env.example` and assess impact on local runs, Docker, GitHub Actions, API, Web, and Desktop.

## Validation

- Backend changes: prefer `./scripts/ci_gate.sh`; at minimum run `python -m py_compile` on changed Python files and the closest deterministic tests.
- Web changes: run `cd apps/dsa-web && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run build`.
- Desktop changes: build web first, then desktop if feasible.
- Review work should prioritize CI evidence (`gh pr checks`, workflow logs) before re-running local validation.
- AI governance changes: run `python scripts/check_ai_assets.py`.

## AI Asset Governance

- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for repository AI collaboration rules.
- `CLAUDE.md` must remain a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.
- Use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for path-specific guidance.
- Current repository collaboration skills live in `.claude/skills/`; keep them aligned with `AGENTS.md`.
